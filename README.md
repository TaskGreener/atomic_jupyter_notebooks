# Atomic Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that can be used to interact with the Atomic API.

A Jupyter notebook contains text and executable (Python) code, but there's no need to be a Python developer to follow along the examples.

## New to using Jupyter notebooks?

There are a few ways to quickly interact with a Jupyter notebook:

- Download the notebook you want to use as an \*.ipynb file and upload it in Google's Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/notebook). You do not have to install anything locally. The only thing that is required is a Google account.

- Run the notebook using GitHub Codespaces. You do not have to install anything locally. The only thing that is required is a GitHub account. Read more about how to do this here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/notebooks-web#_jupyter-notebooks-on-codespaces

- Run the downloaded notebook in your editor of choice. Have a look at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks if you're using VSCode.
